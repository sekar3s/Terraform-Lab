## Terraform Lab Introduction

In these labs, you will gain hands-on exposure to setting up Terraform environment, building and deploying Terraform scripts to deploy Azure resources. You will learn how to authenticate with Terraform's Azure Provider, manage Terraform state on Azure, and how to stand up resources in Azure using Terraform.

The labs includes a self-paced [exercise/challenge](https://github.com/sekar3s/Terraform-Lab/blob/main/Lab/Lab%2003%20-%20Creating%20Terraform%20Modules.md) (in Lab 03) to help you build a Terraform code as a challenge. The labs are split into five parts which build up on each other. 

> **Total Estimated Duration**: 5-6 hours (split into three days)
